/**
 * What each body is offered.

 *   freight; nothing poured loose, because it cannot be tipped out.
 * - Flatbed: open platform. Long and loose freight; no food, no boxes in rain.
 * - Tipper: loose freight only. It tips — that is the whole point of it.
 *
 * The reefer restriction is economic, not physical. A refrigerated truck can of
 * course carry wool or spare parts, and in practice it does when there is no
 * chilled load. But it burns 21 l/100 km against 14–18 for a tarpaulin truck, so
 * offering it dry freight means proposing the most expensive vehicle in the fleet
 * for a job a cheaper one should do. The platform exists to allocate the fleet
 * well; sending a fridge after a pallet of spare parts is the opposite.
 *
 * Food, on the other hand, is not reefer-only: a closed tarpaulin body carries
 * vegetables and packaged groceries perfectly well. Whether a consignment
 * actually needs cold is a separate property of the order, checked separately —
 * conflating the two would leave most of the region's food with no truck at all.
