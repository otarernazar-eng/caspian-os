/**
 * Filling a trip a carrier has already agreed offline.
 *
 * This is the case the region actually lives in. A driver has a deal of his own —
 * «еду в Бейнеу, везу оборудование» — and three tonnes of the body are empty. On
 * the way back the truck is empty entirely. Nothing on a noticeboard helps him:
 * he is not looking for a trip, he is looking for cargo that fits *this* trip.
 *
 * So the question is different from planning a route from scratch. The corridor
 * is fixed and not ours to change; what we choose is which consignments cost the
 * fewest extra kilometres to collect along it.
 *
 * Two lists come back, because they are worth different money to him:
 *
 *   - `along`  — cargo picked up and dropped off between here and there, using
 *                capacity that would otherwise travel as air.
 *   - `back`   — cargo for the return leg, which he is currently planning to
 *                drive empty. This is the one that changes his economics.
